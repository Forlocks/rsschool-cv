## About me
I am 21 years old, study at the St. Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation. At the beginning of my second year at university, I became interested in the profession of a front-end developer, after which I began to take various free courses on learning HTML, CSS and JS. I hope to get more knowledge in the RS School courses so that I can become a junior front-end developer as a result.

  while (n > 0) {
    arr[++j] = n;

  }
